# 🖥️ Graph Algorithms Suite

This repository contains a suite of core graph algorithms implemented in C++. It is designed for educational purposes, algorithmic practice, and potential integration into larger systems. The project covers both classical and advanced algorithms for directed and undirected graphs.

## ✅ Included Algorithms

- **Topological Sort** — for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** — shortest paths with non-negative weights
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** — shortest paths with negative weights detection
- **Hamiltonian Cycle Detection** — brute-force search for Hamiltonian cycles (NP-complete)

## 📚 Purpose

This project is part of a university course on data structures and algorithms. It aims to provide clean, modular, and well-documented implementations of essential graph algorithms.

## 🛠️ Language & Tools

- **Language**: C++
- **Recommended**: [MSYS2 Installation Guide](https://www.msys2.org/).
- **Standard used**: **C++11**
- **Input**: Text files or hardcoded adjacency lists
