# Dijkstra algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights

## Input parameters

- `graph`: graph from which the shortest paths are computed
- `source`: source node from which the shortest paths are computed
- `weights`: nodes weights

## Pseudo-code

```
dijkstra(graph, source, weights):
    initialize_single_source(graph, source)

    set = ∅

    queue = graph.nodes

    while queue != ∅:
        node = queue.extract_min()

        set <- set ∪ node

        for adj_node in node.adj:
            relax(node, adj_node, weights)

```

### _Notes_

`queue` variable is a **minimum priority queue** and the elements inside are ordered by `node.d` value

## `initialize_single_source` and `relax` functions

### `initialize_single_source`

This function initializes the distances and predecessors for all nodes in the graph, setting the source node’s distance to 0 and all other nodes' distances to infinity. It also sets the predecessor of the source node to NIL and all other nodes' predecessors to NIL.

#### Input parameters

- `graph`: the graph to initialize
- `source`: the source node from which distances are computed

#### Pseudo-code

```
initialize_single_source(graph, source):
    for node in (graph.nodes - source):
        node.predecessor = NIL
        node.d = inf

    source.predecessor = NIL
    source.d = 0
```

### `relax`

This function attempts to update the distance of `node2` using the distance of `node1` and the weight of the edge between them. If the new distance through `node1` is smaller than the current distance of `node2`, it updates the distance and sets `node1` as the predecessor of `node2`.

#### Input parameters

- `node1`: source edge node
- `node2`: destination edge node
- `weights`: edges weights

#### Pseudo-code

```
relax(node1, node2, weights):
    if node2.d > node1.d + weights(node1, node2)
        node2.d = node1.d + weights(node1, node2)
        node2.predecessor = node1
```
